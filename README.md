# Library 3D

This project is a personal web application for managing 3D printing models, built using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. This application allows you to upload, view, and download your 3D printing models with ease. The application also provides features to help organize and track your 3D models.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Using ASP.NET Identity, only authenticated users can access the application.

2. **File Upload and Download:** Upload your 3D printing models to the application and download them whenever needed.
